<p>Milli Views started with our CEO, Kyle Exum, struggling with the dilemma of having a passion for video creation and a following, but having trouble finding a stable way to monetize it and make it more than "just a hobby". As a result, Milli Views was born in 2018 with the hopes of solving this issue for all creators. We at Milli Views not only want to monetize social media for our creators, but create an entire industry for it, bringing like-minded talent together to bring their passions to life. Although our company is new, it is run by young creators and business men with the same passion and vision towards social media, all seeing the potential that it has to be a career and a launchpad into an endless number of opportunities.</p>
